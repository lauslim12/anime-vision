# Anime Vision

Anime-Vision is a repository for anime face identification with Deep Learning.

## TODO

- Improve accuracy of the model with TensorFlow's Model Maker
- Improve accuracy of the model with TensorFlow's Make Image Classifier
- Create scraper to fetch raw datasets

## Introduction

Under development.

## Requirements

- Anaconda
- IBM Cloud
- Keras
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow Lite
- TensorFlow 1.15
- TensorFlow 2.10

## Ways to Classify

I'm going to use several ways to classify anime faces. The ways are as follows:
- [x] Using TensorFlow 1.15's Transfer Learning Retrain Script
- [ ] Using IBM Cloud Visual Recognition to recognize faces
- [x] Using TensorFlow Lite's Model Maker
- [ ] Using TensorFlow 2.10's Image Classifier with Keras

## How to Use

Coming soon! Under development.
