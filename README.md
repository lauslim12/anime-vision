# Anime Vision

Anime-Vision is a repository for anime face identification with Deep Learning.

## Introduction

Under development.

## Requirements

- Anaconda
- IBM Cloud
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Tensorflow 1.15
- Tensorflow 2.10

## Ways to Classify

I'm going to use several ways to classify anime faces. The ways are as follows:
- [x] Using Tensorflow 1.15's Transfer Learning Retrain Script
- [ ] Using IBM Cloud Visual Recognition to recognize faces
- [ ] Using Tensorflow Lite's Model Maker
- [ ] Using Tensorflow 2.10's Image Classifier with Keras

## How to Use

Coming soon! Under development.
